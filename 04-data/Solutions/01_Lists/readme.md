# Lists  
In this unit you will learn the most important things you need to know about lists in Python. 

## Help! My code doesn't work
Make sure that you check for the following things:
- The list name is identical everywhere it is used (capitals matter)
- List index is surrounded by **square** brackets
- List indexing starts at **zero** - are you counting properly?


## Task 1 - Predict and Run
Look at the example code in the files ```task1-1.py``` - ```task1-4.py``` and study it carefully.  Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs (Your prediction should be added to the code as comments). 

Run the code to see if you were correct!

## Task 2 - Investigate
Look at the code in the files ```task2-1.py``` - ```task2-2.py``` and study it carefully. Write a comment to answer the questions.


## Task 3 - Modify
Adapt the code in the file ```task3.py``` to solve the described problems. Add comments to show what it does.

## Task 4 - Make
Write your own code to solve at the tasks described in the files ```taks4-1.py``` and ```task4-2.py```.
