# Files  
In this unit you will learn the most important things you need to work with files in Python. 

## Task 1 - Predict and Run
Look at the example code in the files ```task1-1.py``` - ```task1-5.py``` and study it carefully.  Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs (Your prediction should be added to the code as comments). 

Run the code to see if you were correct!

## Task 2 - Make
Write your own code to solve at the tasks described in the files ```taks2.py```.
