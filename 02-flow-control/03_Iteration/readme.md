# Iteration  
In this unit you will learn the most important things you need to know about indefinite and definite loops in Python. 

## Task 1 - Predict and Run
Look at the example code in the files ```task1-1.py``` - ```task1-4.py``` and study it carefully.  Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs (Your prediction should be added to the code as comments). 

Run the code to see if you were correct!

## Task 2 - Investigate
Look at the code in the files ```task2-1.py``` - ```task2-2.py``` and study it carefully. Write a comment to answer the questions.

## Task 3 - Modify
Adapt the code in the files ```task3-1.py``` and ```task3-2.py``` to solve the described problems. Add comments to show what it does.

## Task 4 - Make
Write your own code to solve at the tasks described in the files ```taks4-1.py``` and ```task4-2.py```. 

## Help! My code doesn't work
Make sure that you check for the following things:

- indefinite iteration begins with ```while```
- the while line has a condition
- the definite iteration begins with a ```for```
- you can break out of loops using ```break```
- you can finish an iteration with ```continue```
- **all** the code you want to repeat is indented after the while.
- any code that should run once the loop has finished is **not indented**
