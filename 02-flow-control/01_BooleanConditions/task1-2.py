# Add comments to the code below to predict what will happen when it is run.

# Example 1
x = 50
y = 50
print(x + y == 100 and x >= y)

# Example 2
x = 50
y = 50
print(x + y == 100 and x >= y and not y == 50)

# Example 3
fname = "Homer"
lname = "Simpson"
age = 66
print(fname + " " + lname == "Homer Simpson" and age > 55)

# Example 4
x = 10
print(x>10 or x<10)

# Example 5
fname = "Homer"
lname = "Simpson"
print((fname == "Homer" and lname == "Homer") or (lname == "Simpson" and fname == "Homer"))

# Example 6
x = True
y = True
z = False
print(x or y or z)
