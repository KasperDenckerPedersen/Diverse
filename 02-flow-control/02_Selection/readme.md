# Selection  
In this unit you will learn the most important things you need to know about selection using ```if```, ```elif```, and ```else``` statements in Python. 

## Task 1 - Predict and Run
Look at the example code in the files ```task1-1.py``` - ```taks1-5.py``` and study it carefully.  Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs (Your prediction should be added to the code as comments). 

Run the code to see if you were correct!

## Task 2 - Investigate
Look at the code in the file ```task2.py``` and study it carefully. Write a comment to answer the questions.

## Task 3 - Modify
Adapt the code in the file ```task3.py``` to solve the described problems. Add comments to show what it does.

## Task 4 - Make
Write your own code to solve at the tasks described in the files ```taks4-1.py``` and ```task4-2.py```. 

## Help! My code doesn't work
Make sure that you check for the following things:
- selection begins with 'if' has as many 'elif's in the middle as you need and end with 'else'
- a colon at the end of each if and else line.
- each branch is indented unsing the TAB key (not just spaces)
- if, elif & else **aren't** indented
- a condition after each 'if' and 'elif'
- no condition after 'else'
- a **double** equals in the condition when chcking that two pieces of data are the same.
