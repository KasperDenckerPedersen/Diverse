# Example 1
x = 10
y = 50
print(x > y) # Compare if x is bigger than y and print the result (False)

# Example 2
x = "Summer"
y = "Winter"
print(x == "Summer") # Compare if x is equal to the string "Summer" and print the result (True)

# Example 3
print(5 >= 7) # Compare if 5 ist bigger or equal to 7 and print the result (False)

# Example 4
print("Hello" != "World") # Compare if the strings "Hello" and "World" are unequal and print the result (True)

# Example 5
print("Hello" == "hello") # Compare if the strings "Hello" and "hello" are equal and print the result (False)
