# Add comments to the code below to predict what will happen when it is run.

# Example 1
x = 50
y = 50
print(x + y == 100 and x >= y) # Compare if x + y are equal to 100 and if x is larger or equal to y print the result (True)

# Example 2
x = 50
y = 50
print(x + y == 100 and x >= y and not y == 50) # Compare if x + y are equal to 100 and if x is larger or equal to y and if y is not equal to 50 print the result (False)

# Example 3
fname = "Homer"
lname = "Simpson"
age = 66
print(fname + " " + lname == "Homer Simpson" and age > 55) # True

# Example 4
x = 10
print(x>10 or x<10) # False

# Example 5
fname = "Homer"
lname = "Simpson"
print((fname == "Homer" and lname == "Homer") or (lname == "Simpson" and fname == "Homer")) # True

# Example 6
x = True
y = True
z = False
print(x or y or z) # True
