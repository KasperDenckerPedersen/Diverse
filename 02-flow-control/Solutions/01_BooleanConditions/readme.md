# Boolean Conditions  
In this unit you will learn the most important things you need to know about variables in Python. 

## Task 1 - Predict and Run
Look at the example code in the files ```task1-1.py``` - ```taks1-2.py``` and study it carefully.  Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs (Your prediction should be added to the code as comments). 

Run the code to see if you were correct!

## Task 2 - Investigate
Look at the code in the file ```task2.py```and study it carefully. Write a comment to answer the questions.


## Task 3 - Modify
Adapt the code in the file ```task3.py``` to solve the described problem. Add comments to show what it does.

## Task 4 - Make
Write your own code to solve at the tasks described in the file ```taks4.py```. 


## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!
Make sure that you check for the following things:
*   You only compare variables of the same data type
*   You use double equals in the condition when checking if two pieces of data are the same
