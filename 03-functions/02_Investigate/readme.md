# Functions  - Investigate
In this unit you will learn the most important things you need to know about functions in Python. 

Look at the example code in the files ```task1.py``` - ```task4.py``` and study it carefully.  Write a comment to answer the questions.

Run the code to see if you were correct!

## Help! My code doesn't work
Make sure that you check for the following things:
- The function name is identical everywhere it is used (capitals matter)
- The function call is **not** indented inside the subroutine
- The function is defined **before** it has been called
