'''
In this make task, we will write a function calculating the factorial of a number given as input. 
The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number (e.g. 5! = 5*4*3*2*1, ...). 
Hint: You can use recursion to solve this task.

Bonus import the module time and use its ``time()``` function (```time.time()```) to determine how long your program takes to calculate the factorial.
