# Functions  - Make
In this unit you will learn the most important things you need to know about functions in Python. 

Write your own code to solve at the tasks described in the files ```task1.py``` and ```task2.py```. 

Run the code to see if you were correct!

## Help! My code doesn't work
Make sure that you check for the following things:
- The function name is identical everywhere it is used (capitals matter)
- The function call is **not** indented inside the subroutine
- The function is defined **before** it has been called
