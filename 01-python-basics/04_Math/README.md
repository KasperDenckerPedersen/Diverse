# Arithmetic Operators  
In this unit you will learn the most important things you need to know about arithmetic operators and simple calculations in Python. 

## Task 1 - Predict and Run
Look at the example code in the files ```task1-1.py``` - ```task1-4.py``` and study it carefully.  Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs (Your prediction should be added to the code as comments). 

Run the code to see if you were correct!

## Task 2 - Investigate
Look at the code in the files ```task2-1.py``` - ```task2-2.py``` and study it carefully. Write a comment to answer the questions.


## Task 3 - Modify
Adapt the code in the files ```task3-1.py``` and ```task3-2.py``` to solve the described problems. Add comments to show what it does.

## Task 4 - Make
Write your own code to solve at the tasks described in the files ```taks4-1.py``` and ```task4-2.py```. 

## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!
Make sure that you check for the following things:

- you have typed the variable name **exactly** the same (including caps), every time
- There is a variable on the **left** of each assignment
- You have used a single **=** for assignment
- You have casted your intput to an integer variable
- You have used the correct **operator**
    - \+ addition
    - \- subtraction
    - \* multiplication
    - / decimal division (gives numbers after the decimal point)
    - // integer (floor) division (just gives the whole number part of the answer)
    - % Modulus (remainder of the euclidean division of one number by another)
    - ** Exponentiation
