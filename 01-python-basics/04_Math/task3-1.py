# Instructions

# The code will generate an error. Look carefully to see what is wrong with the code and fix it.

# Add a text prompt between lines 3 and 4 to tell the user to enter a number.

# Complete line 8 to concatenate total1 into the output statement.

# Add a new variable with a sensible identifier.  Multiply num1 and num2 together and assign the result into this variable.

# Output num1, num2 and your new variable in a similar format to line 8.
