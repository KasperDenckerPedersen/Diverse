# Output  
In this unit you will learn the most important things you need to know about Python's ```print()``` function. 

## Task 1 - Predict, Run and Investigate
In the first task, we will work with simple ```print()``` statements that outputs text to the console.

Look at the example code in the files ```task1-1.py``` - ```task1-4.py``` and study it carefully.  Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs (Your prediction should be added to the code as comments). 
Run the code to see if you were correct!

## Task 2 - Modify
Reuse the print statement in ```taks2.py``` to add your own single line message to the program.

## Task 3 - Make
Write a print statement in ```taks1-6.py``` to output a joke that appears on multiple lines (keep it clean!).  Extra challenge â€“ can you figure out how to add blank lines like in the following joke?
```
What's the best thing about Switzerland?

I don't know, but the flag is a big plus.
```

## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!
Make sure that you check for the following things:
- print does not have a capital letter
- The string text is surrounded with speech marks
- The string (including speech marks) is surrounded by brackets.
