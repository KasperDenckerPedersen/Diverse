# Add comments to the code below to explain what it does

sentence = "Hello, world!" # Assign the string "Hello, world!" to the variable sentence

print(3*sentence) # Concatenate the string stored in the variable sentence 3 times and output the result

# Bonus: Can you change this code to use a new line everytime it prints the sentence? 
sentence = "Hello, world!\n" # Add a line break at the end of the string
print(3*sentence)
