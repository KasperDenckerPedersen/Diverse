fName = "Mr"
lName = "Colley"

print(fName)

# Identify a variable in the code
    # fName (or lName)

# Identify a string in the code
    # "Mr" (or "Colley")

# Line 4 is changed to lName = "Thorpe".  How does this affect the output?
    # The output will not be affected as we only print the value in the variable fName

# Line 3 is changed to fName = "Mrs". How does this affect the output?
    # The output will change from "Mr" to "Mrs"
