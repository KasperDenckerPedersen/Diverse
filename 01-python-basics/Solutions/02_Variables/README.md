# Variables  
In this unit you will learn the most important things you need to know about variables in Python. 

## Task 1 - Predict and Run
Look at the example code in the files ```task1-1.py``` - ```taks1-4.py``` and study it carefully.  Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs (Your prediction should be added to the code as comments). 

Run the code to see if you were correct!

## Task 2 - Investigate
Look at the code in the files ```task2-1.py``` - ```task2-4.py``` and study it carefully. Write a comment to answer the questions.


## Task 3 - Modify
Adapt the code in the files ```task3-1.py``` and ```task3-2.py``` to solve the described problems. Add comments to show what it does.

## Task 4 - Make
Write your own code to solve at the tasks described in the files ```taks4-1.py``` and ```task4-2.py```. 

## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!
Make sure that you check for the following things:
*   No two variables can have the same name.
*   Variable names should be meaningful (give you a clue as to the data stored therein
*   Variable names start with a lowercase letter.
*   Variable names cannot contain spaces.
*   If a variable name is more than one word long, capitalise the first letter of the second word onwards, like this this is known as **[camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case#:~:text=Camel%20case%20(stylized%20as%20camelCase,no%20intervening%20spaces%20or%20punctuation))** :
      *  ```thisIsAnExampleVariableName```
