# Add comments to the code below to explain what it does

firstName = "Homer" # Assign the string "Homer" to the variable firstName

lastName = "Simpson" # Assign the string "Simpson" to the variable lastName

fullName = firstName + " " + lastName # Concatenate the strings in the two variables and assign the resulting string to the variable fullName

age = 61 # Assign the integer 61 to the variable age

welcomeMessage = f"Hi! My name is {fullName} and I'm {age} years old." # Concatenate the variables into an output string using the f-string mechanics and assign the resulting string to the variable welcomeMessage

print(welcomeMessage) # Output the value of the variable welcomeMessage to the console
