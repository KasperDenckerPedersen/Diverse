  # The "=" operator

# What value is stored in total1 at the end of the program?
  # 100

# What value is stored in num3 at the end of the program?
  # The value entered by the user converted to an integer

# Line 8 is changed to total1 = num1 // num2. How would it affect the program?
  # It would change the value of total3, the output would not be affected as the variable is not used later
