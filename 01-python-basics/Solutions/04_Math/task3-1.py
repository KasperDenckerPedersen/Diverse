# Add a text prompt to tell the user to enter a number.
# Complete line 7 to concatenate total1 into the output statement.
# Add a new variable with a sensible identifier.  Multiply num1 and num2 together and assign the result into this variable.
# Output num1, num2 and your new variable in a similar format to line 7.
