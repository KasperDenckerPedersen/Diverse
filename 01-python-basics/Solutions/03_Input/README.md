# Input  
In this unit you will learn the most important things you need to know about user input in Python. 

## Task 1 - Predict and Run
Look at the example code in the files ```task1-1.py``` - ```taks1-2.py``` and study it carefully.  Write a prediction of what it will do when it runs (Your prediction should be added to the code as comments). 

Run the code to see if you were correct!

## Task 2 - Investigate
Look at the code in the files ```task2-1.py``` - ```task2-3.py``` and study it carefully. Write a comment to answer the questions.

## Task 3 - Modify
Adapt the code in the files ```task3-1.py``` and ```task3-2.py``` to solve the described problems. Add comments to show what it does.

## Task 4 - Make
Lots of websites use chatbots to interact with their customers.  These chatbots are often very sophisticated and use AI to learn and adapt to the user. Our chat bot is going to be a bit simpler. We will write a simple chatbot that helps users to generate an add to sell their used car.
 
The chatbot should work like this:
- Ask the user for the make and model of the car
- Ask the user for the mileage of the car
- Ask the user for the price of the car
- Ask the user for the power of the car
- Ask the user for the contact information (name, email address)
- Output the add for the car

## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!
Make sure that you check for the following things:
- you have typed the variable name **exactly** the same (including caps), every time
- There is a variable on the **left** of each assignment
- You have used a single **=** for assignment
